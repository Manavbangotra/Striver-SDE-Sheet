# Reverse Linked List 
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

O(N) Time and O(1) space, iterative
* Initialize three pointers prev as NULL, curr as head and next as NULL.
* Iterate through the linked list. In loop, do following.

. Before changing next of current, store next node next = curr->next
. Now change next of current This is where actual reversing happens curr->next = prev
. Move prev and curr one step forward prev = curr curr = next
