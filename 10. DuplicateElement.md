# Duplicate Element
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

O(N^2) Brute force
* check for all numbers if duplicate number exists.

O(NlogN) Sorting
* Sort the array and duplicate numbers will be next to each other.
