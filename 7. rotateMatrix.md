# Rotate Matrix 
 
 Brute force approach
 * first row is getting converted into the last column.
 * The jth index of the matrix becomes the ith index of the matrix, so we can create an auxillary space matrix for this purpose.
 * arr[j][n-1-i]= mat[i][j]
 
 Better Approach
 * transpose a matrix 
 * reverse a matrix 
 * using inplace approach
 * for 0th row j goes 1 to 3
 * for 1st row j goes 2 to 3
 * for 2nd row j goes 3
 * j always start 1 ahead of i
 * then just reverse all the rows in a matrix
