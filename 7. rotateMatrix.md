# Rotate Matrix 
 
 Brute force approach
 * first row is getting converted into last column.
 * the jth index of matrix becoming the ith index of matrix, so we can create a auxillary space matrix for this purpose.
 * arr[j][n-1-i]= mat[i][j]
 
 Better Approach
 * transpose a matrix 
 * reverse a matrix
 * using inplace approach
