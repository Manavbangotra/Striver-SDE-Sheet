# Merge Sorted Arrays
O(M+N) Time and O(M+N) space
* Create new array with m+n elements.
* Traverse through both the given array, find min and insert in the new array.
O(M*N) without using extra Space
* Traverse through both the given array
* If arr1[i]>arr2[i] then swap the elements and sort the second array.(here sorting means just put swapped element at its right position not real sorting)
O(M+N) Time and O(1) Space
* self explanatory
